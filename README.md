### Hi there 👋

<!--
**julianobressan/julianobressan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Juliano Bressan, from Brazil. I'm a full stack software developer since 2008 and currently I'm  working on my new project, [BRX Digital](http://brxdigital.com), a brand new agency of software solutions. I'm a senior backend developer in .NET (C#) + SQL Server) and PHP + MySQL. I'm pretty good with SQL developing and administration, as well. I’m currently learning Javascripts frameworks, like React and Node.js, focusing in mobile apps and websites.

Would you like to find me?
